# Exmple Story Using MDX

This is an example of how we can create a prototype view using markdown language with embeded jsx.

We can drop it in a `Preview` to get a code snippet:

<Preview>
  <Chip label="Basic" />
</Preview>

The above can be writen as a story like:
```
<Story name="basic" >
  <Chip label="Basic" />
</Story>
```
Or templated like:
```
export const Template = (args) => <Chip {...args} />;
<Story
  name="basic"
  args={{
    label: "Basic",
  }}
>
  {Template.bind({})}
</Story>

```

<Story
  name="basic"
  args={{
    label: "Basic",
  }}
>
  {Template.bind({})}
</Story>

We can drop it in a `Canvas` to get a code snippet:

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="clickable"
    args={{
      label: "clickable",
      onClick: () => {},
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

We can even preview multiple stories in a block. This
gets rendered as a group, but defines individual stories
with unique URLs and isolated snapshot tests.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="deletable"
    args={{
      label: "deletable",
      onDelete: () => {},
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
  <Story
    name="secondary"
    args={{
      label: "secondary",
      color: "secondary",
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
